COMMENTS: "Single crystal GaSe (o). Polar angle (θ): 0°. Electric field was parallel to the X dielectric axis. 170 fs and 190 fs at 2.2 μm and 3.2 μm, respectively. Estimated Kerr values were 35.2e-19 m<sup>2</sup>/W and 34.7e-19 m<sup>2</sup>/W at 2.2 μm and 3.2 μm, respectively.  Fourier Interferometry."
