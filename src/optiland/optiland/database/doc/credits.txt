The refractiveindex.info database was initiated by me in 2008, and I've been its caretaker, maintaining and expanding it ever since. Despite being a full-time employee at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), I work on this database as a personal project separate from my professional duties, dedicating my personal time to it.

An exception to this is the "n2" section. This part was integrated into the refractiveindex.info database in 2023 as a segment of a research and development effort at BNL. This effort was funded by a U.S. Department of Energy grant, aimed at studying optical materials for high-power, long-wave infrared lasers (B&R code KW0101020). Just like the rest of the database, the development of this section will continue as a personal project.

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the many researchers who have contributed to the database over the years. They've provided data, reported bugs, and suggested enhancements.

It's also worth noting that I have occasionally utilized access to subscription-based scientific journals provided by BNL.

In January 2015, I chose to release the database to the public under the free-as-freedom CC0 dedication.

In addition to the database, I developed the RefractiveIndex.INFO website independently in my personal time. This website serves as a user-friendly interface for the refractiveindex.info database, and it also allows for some basic calculations.
