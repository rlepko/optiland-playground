<h1>Gorilla glass</h1>

Gorilla Glass is a brand of chemically strengthened glass developed by Corning Inc., designed to be thin, light, and resistant to damage. It's most commonly used in consumer electronics like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to provide a protective yet transparent surface. Unlike traditional soda-lime glass, Gorilla Glass undergoes a chemical strengthening process involving ion exchange to increase its surface durability. This results in a glass that is highly resistant to scratches, impacts, and even bending to some extent. Despite its strength, Gorilla Glass maintains excellent optical clarity and touch sensitivity, making it ideal for modern touch-screen interfaces. Over the years, various iterations of Gorilla Glass have been developed, each improving on the strength, thinness, or scratch resistance of the previous versions. As consumer electronics continue to evolve towards slimmer designs with larger, more vulnerable displays, Gorilla Glass has become an essential material for ensuring durability without sacrificing aesthetic or functional qualities.
