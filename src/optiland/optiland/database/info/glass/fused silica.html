<h1>Fused silica</h1>

Fused silica is a high-purity form of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), known for its exceptional thermal stability, low thermal expansion, and high resistance to chemical corrosion. It is often used in applications requiring superior optical transmission over a wide spectral range, from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). Fused silica is made by melting high-purity silica at extremely high temperatures, resulting in a material that is both optically clear and highly homogeneous. These properties make it an ideal choice for a variety of demanding applications such as UV optics, semiconductor manufacturing, and high-power laser systems. Furthermore, its low coefficient of thermal expansion makes it highly stable under fluctuating temperature conditions, an essential quality for precision optical components. Overall, fused silica's unique set of properties, including its purity, thermal stability, and broad transmission range, make it a cornerstone material in high-performance optical systems.
