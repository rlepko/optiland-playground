<h1>Soda lime glass</h1>

Soda-lime glass is one of the most common types of glass and serves as a workhorse material in a wide range of applications. Composed primarily of silica, soda, and lime, this type of glass is known for its relatively low cost, ease of production, and versatility. Soda-lime glass is often used in containers, windows, and a myriad of everyday products. While it is not as resistant to high temperatures or corrosive materials as some specialized glasses like borosilicate, it offers good optical clarity and can be easily molded, blown, or drawn into various shapes. Soda-lime glass is also amenable to treatments like tempering or laminating to enhance its mechanical strength or safety features. Its physical and chemical properties make it well-suited for applications where extreme conditions are not a factor, but affordability and versatility are valued.
