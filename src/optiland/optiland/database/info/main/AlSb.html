<h1>Aluminium antimonide, AlSb</h1>

AlSb, or aluminum antimonide, is a III-V semiconductor compound with a zincblende crystal structure. It has a direct bandgap of approximately 1.6 eV at room temperature and is known for its high electron mobility, which makes it useful in high-frequency and high-speed electronic applications. AlSb is often utilized in heterostructures with other III-V materials, such as GaSb and InAs, to create devices like high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) and infrared photodetectors. The material has a relatively low effective mass of electrons, which contributes to its high electron mobility and thereby makes it desirable for applications requiring rapid electron transport. AlSb is also of interest for thermophotovoltaic applications, given its narrow bandgap energy, which allows for efficient absorption of infrared radiation. However, the material poses challenges in terms of crystal growth and fabrication due to its sensitivity to defects and impurities. Additionally, antimonide-based materials like AlSb require stringent safety protocols due to the toxicity of antimony. Despite these challenges, AlSb continues to be a material of significant research interest, offering a combination of electrical and optical properties that are attractive for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.
