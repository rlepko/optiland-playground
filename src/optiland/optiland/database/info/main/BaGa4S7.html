<h1>BaGa<sub>4</sub>S<sub>7</sub> (BGS)</h1>

BaGa<sub>4</sub>S<sub>7</sub>, often abbreviated as BGS in scientific literature and industry documents, is a nonlinear optical crystal known for its high phase-matching capabilities, especially in the visible and near-infrared regions. This material is particularly valuable for frequency conversion applications, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG) and sum-frequency generation (SFG), owing to its high nonlinear optical coefficients. BaGa<sub>4</sub>S<sub>7</sub> is also known for its high laser damage threshold, making it a robust choice for high-power optical applications. Typically grown through methods like the Bridgman technique, the crystal can be precisely cut and polished to create high-quality optical elements. One consideration for users is the material's sensitivity to moisture and chemicals, which necessitates careful handling and storage to preserve its optical properties. Despite this, BaGa<sub>4</sub>S<sub>7</sub> remains a highly attractive material for various nonlinear optical applications, especially those requiring wide tunability, high power-handling, and efficient phase-matching capabilities.
