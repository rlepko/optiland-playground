<h1>Bismuth triborate, BiB<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (BiBO)</h1>

BiB<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, commonly known as bismuth triborate or BiBO, is a nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal that has gained prominence for its exceptionally high damage threshold and broad phase-matching capabilities. It is frequently used in frequency doubling, tripling, and mixing applications in high-intensity laser systems, as well as in optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and generators (OPGs). BiBO offers wide angular and spectral phase-matching conditions, allowing for flexibility in optical design. It also has a high nonlinear coefficient, which contributes to its efficiency in nonlinear frequency conversion processes. The crystal can be grown using the Czochralski method and offers superior thermal stability compared to many other NLO materials. One of its notable advantages is that it is non-hygroscopic, making it less sensitive to moisture and easier to handle. Although bismuth elements can be toxic, the stability of the BiBO compound under standard conditions limits risks associated with handling. Overall, BiBO stands out as one of the most promising nonlinear optical materials for high-power laser applications due to its remarkable properties and operational versatility.
