<h1>Bismuth ferrite, BiFeO<sub>3</sub> (BFO)</h1>

BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, commonly known as bismuth ferrite (BFO), is a multiferroic material that exhibits both ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic properties. In the realm of optics and optoelectronics, BFO has garnered interest for its potential in creating multifunctional devices, leveraging its coupled electric and magnetic order parameters. It shows promise for applications in photovoltaics, data storage, and spintronic devices due to its strong magnetoelectric coupling. The material possesses a distorted perovskite structure, which gives rise to its unique properties. Various methods, such as sol-gel, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), can be used to synthesize high-quality BFO films. The material has also been doped with elements like lanthanum and titanium to enhance its functional properties or to adjust its bandgap for specific applications. One of the challenges with BFO is its relatively low Curie temperature and weak ferromagnetism at room temperature. Nonetheless, the ability to control both electric and magnetic properties by external fields makes BFO a subject of intensive research for future optoelectronic devices and sensors.
