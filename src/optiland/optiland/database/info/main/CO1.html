<h1>Carbon monoxide, CO</h1>

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly lighter than air. It is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels such as coal, wood, and petroleum products. CO has significant importance as both an industrial reagent and a pollutant. In industrial applications, it is used in processes like the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce hydrocarbons and in the production of methanol. However, due to its ability to bind with hemoglobin much more effectively than oxygen, it is highly toxic to animals and humans when inhaled, leading to symptoms like headaches, dizziness, and, at high concentrations, even death. Carbon monoxide is also a significant atmospheric pollutant, playing a role in the formation of ground-level ozone and smog. Various sensors and detectors are available for monitoring CO levels in both industrial and residential settings. Given its dual nature as both a useful industrial reagent and a hazardous pollutant, the handling, and management of CO require significant safety precautions.
