<h1>Carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub></h1>

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a colorless, odorless gas that plays a critical role in various industrial, environmental, and biological systems. Composed of two oxygen atoms covalently bonded to a central carbon atom, CO<sub>2</sub> is a linear molecule with diverse applications. One notable use is in CO<sub>2</sub> lasers, which produce a high-power infrared beam and are employed in applications ranging from cutting and welding to surgical procedures. Aside from its technological uses, CO<sub>2</sub> is perhaps most recognized for its role as a greenhouse gas. It has a significant long-term warming effect on Earth's climate, contributing to global warming and subsequent climate change. This has led to intensive research into CO<sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration technologies, as well as international policies aimed at emission reduction. Other industrial uses include its role as a refrigerant, a fire suppressant, and as a solvent in supercritical fluid applications. Given its wide range of applications and environmental implications, CO<sub>2</sub> remains a molecule of great scientific, industrial, and global significance.
