<h1>Calcium magnesium carbonate, CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub></h1>

Calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), commonly known as dolomite, is a double carbonate mineral that exhibits a range of properties making it versatile for various applications. It has a trigonal crystal structure and often occurs as rhombohedral crystals or granular masses. Dolomite's optical properties are of interest in the field of mineralogy, including its birefringence and its ability to fluoresce under ultraviolet light. However, its primary applications are industrial and not optical. It serves as a significant resource for magnesium and is extensively used in the production of cement and as a filler material in various industries like rubber, paints, and plastics. It is also a key component in agricultural lime, which is used to adjust soil pH and improve plant health. In the environmental context, dolomite is often used for water treatment and as a soil conditioner. Its natural abundance, coupled with its diverse range of applications, makes dolomite an economically important mineral in both industrial and agricultural sectors.
