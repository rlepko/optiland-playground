<h1>Calcium molybdate, CaMoO<sub>4</sub></h1>

Calcium molybdate (CaMoO<sub>4</sub>) is an inorganic compound with a tetragonal crystal structure, widely used as a scintillator material for radiation detection applications. It exhibits a high density, good thermal stability, and strong resistance to radiation damage. When doped with rare-earth ions or other activators, CaMoO<sub>4</sub> can demonstrate enhanced scintillation efficiency, making it particularly useful for gamma-ray and X-ray detection. Its optical properties, including a moderate refractive index and wide bandgap, have also led to its exploration as a host material for solid-state laser applications. The compound can be synthesized through various methods such as solid-state reaction, hydrothermal processes, or co-precipitation. It's worth noting that its non-hygroscopic nature allows for easy handling and long-term stability. Overall, the favorable physical and optical properties of calcium molybdate make it a material of interest in both scientific research and practical applications, particularly in the fields of radiation detection and optoelectronics.
