<h1>Cadmium gallium sulfide, CdGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub></h1>

Cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) is an inorganic ternary compound that belongs to the family of chalcopyrite semiconductors. It commonly crystallizes in a tetragonal structure and is of interest for its optoelectronic and nonlinear optical properties. Due to its large bandgap and high nonlinear optical coefficients, CdGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> is particularly suitable for frequency conversion applications in lasers, serving as a second- or third-harmonic generation material. Additionally, its capability to absorb and emit in the visible and near-infrared range makes it a potential material for photodetectors, photovoltaic cells, and light-emitting diodes. The compound is typically synthesized using techniques like solid-state reactions, chemical vapor deposition, or hydrothermal methods, allowing for control over its crystal quality and stoichiometry. Despite its promising properties, the presence of toxic cadmium necessitates careful handling and environmental considerations. Overall, CdGa<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> offers a compelling array of attributes for optical and optoelectronic applications and continues to be a subject of active research.
