<h1>Cadmium germanium arsenide, CdGeAs<sub>2</sub></h1>

Cadmium germanium arsenide (CdGeAs<sub>2</sub>) is an inorganic compound that crystallizes in a chalcopyrite structure, exhibiting intriguing optical and optoelectronic properties. It is particularly noteworthy for its significant nonlinear optical coefficients and phase-matching capabilities. This makes CdGeAs<sub>2</sub> a valuable material for frequency conversion applications, such as second-harmonic generation and parametric oscillation, especially in the mid-infrared range. Furthermore, the material's large bandgap allows it to operate at elevated temperatures without significant thermal degradation, making it suitable for harsh environmental conditions. However, the presence of toxic elements like cadmium and arsenic requires special handling precautions and may limit its widespread adoption. CdGeAs<sub>2</sub> can be synthesized through various methods, including Bridgman-Stockbarger and Czochralski techniques, which are employed to yield high-quality single crystals. Given its specialized capabilities in nonlinear optics and durability in challenging conditions, CdGeAs<sub>2</sub> remains a material of particular interest in advanced optical applications.
