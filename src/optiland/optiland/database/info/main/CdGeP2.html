<h1>Cadmium germanium phosphide, CdGeP<sub>2</sub></h1>

Cadmium germanium phosphide (CdGeP<sub>2</sub>) is an inorganic compound that crystallizes in a chalcopyrite-type structure. This material has gained attention for its unique nonlinear optical properties, particularly its phase-matching capabilities and significant nonlinear optical coefficients. CdGeP<sub>2</sub> is often used in frequency conversion applications, including second-harmonic generation and parametric oscillation, predominantly in the mid-infrared spectral range. Its large bandgap and good thermal stability make it suitable for high-temperature and high-power applications. However, the presence of toxic cadmium calls for careful handling and may limit its broader use. Synthesis methods for CdGeP<sub>2</sub> include Bridgman-Stockbarger and Czochralski techniques, which aim to produce high-quality single crystals for specialized optical applications. Despite the environmental and handling challenges posed by its toxic components, CdGeP<sub>2</sub> remains an attractive material for advanced nonlinear optical applications and continues to be the subject of ongoing research.
