<h1>Cerium, Ce</h1>

Cerium (Ce) is a soft, ductile, and silvery-white metal that is the most abundant of the rare-earth elements. It typically exists in two oxidation states: Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>, making it a powerful reducing agent and an interesting component in various optical, catalytic, and electronic applications. In particular, cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>) finds use in catalytic converters, solid oxide fuel cells, and chemical mechanical planarization processes due to its ability to switch between the two oxidation states. Cerium-doped materials are also of considerable interest in the fields of luminescence and scintillation, where they serve as dopants in phosphors and scintillator crystals. Methods for obtaining high-purity cerium include solvent extraction and ion-exchange techniques. While cerium is not as toxic as other heavy metals, proper handling and disposal methods are still advised. Ongoing research aims to exploit cerium's unique redox behavior and electron structure for new applications in environmental remediation, energy storage, and advanced manufacturing.
