<h1>Cesium bromide, CsBr</h1>

Caesium bromide (CsBr) is an ionic compound composed of caesium and bromine atoms in a 1:1 ratio. It forms colorless, hygroscopic crystals and is highly soluble in water. The compound has applications in various fields, including analytical chemistry, where it is used as a scintillation material in scintillation counters. Additionally, it serves as a transparent material in the infrared spectral range, making it useful in infrared optics. CsBr is also utilized in the manufacturing of certain high-performance photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices. Despite its utility, caesium bromide should be handled with care due to the reactivity of caesium and the potential for bromine to form harmful by-products. It can react vigorously with substances like acids and water, so proper safety precautions must be observed during handling and storage. Overall, CsBr is a material of interest for various specialized applications, particularly those involving infrared technology and radiation detection.
