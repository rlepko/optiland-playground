<h1>Caesium chloride, CsCl</h1>

Caesium chloride (CsCl) is an inorganic compound that forms colorless, water-soluble crystals with a simple cubic structure. It is widely used in various applications, including as an electrolyte in electrochemical studies and as a source of caesium ions in chemical processes. One of its most notable uses is in molecular biology for density gradient ultracentrifugation, where it effectively separates various types of DNA. Specifically, CsCl gradients are highly effective for isolating plasmid DNA from other cellular components. Although it has considerable utility in laboratory settings, caesium chloride must be handled with care. It can be corrosive, and excessive exposure can pose health risks, such as disruptions in cellular potassium ion channels that could lead to arrhythmias. Therefore, strict safety protocols are required for its handling and storage. Overall, CsCl is a compound of significant importance in both scientific research and industrial applications.
