<h1>Caesium lithium borate, CsLiB<sub>6</sub>O<sub>10</sub> (CLBO)</h1>

Caesium lithium borate (CsLiB<sub>6</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, commonly abbreviated as CLBO) is an inorganic, nonlinear optical crystal that is gaining prominence for its unique characteristics. This material has a broad transparency range, from ultraviolet to mid-infrared, and exhibits a high damage threshold, making it especially suitable for high-power laser applications. It also offers phase-matching capabilities, which are crucial for frequency conversion processes in laser systems. CLBO is used in a variety of optical applications including second-harmonic generation, sum-frequency generation, and optical parametric oscillation. While it offers several advantages, it is hygroscopic and thus must be carefully handled and stored to prevent degradation from moisture. Due to its specialized use in high-performance laser systems and other optoelectronic devices, it is typically more expensive than other types of nonlinear optical crystals. Overall, CLBO is a highly specialized material that has carved out a niche in high-power laser systems and nonlinear optics.
