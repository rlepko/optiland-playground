<h1>Gallium nitride, GaN</h1>

Gallium nitride (GaN) is a binary III/V direct bandgap semiconductor commonly used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for both general lighting and displays. With a wide bandgap of about 3.4 eV, GaN is also highly valued for its thermal stability, which makes it particularly useful in high-power and high-frequency applications. It is an essential material in the fabrication of high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) and is increasingly used in high-frequency and high-power radar and communication systems. GaN has gained prominence in optoelectronics, specifically in the development of blue LEDs, which led to energy-efficient white LEDs and was recognized with the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. It is often grown on substrates like sapphire or silicon carbide, although the industry is moving towards native GaN substrates for higher performance.
