<h1>Gallium sulfide, GaS</h1>

Gallium sulfide (GaS) is a binary compound with a layered structure, belonging to the family of III-VI semiconductors. It has an indirect band gap of approximately 3.0 eV and is not as commonly used as other III-V compounds like GaAs or GaN. However, GaS exhibits intriguing optoelectronic and nonlinear optical properties, making it a material of interest for specialized applications. It can be synthesized in both crystalline and thin-film forms, and it has been explored for use in photodetectors and photovoltaic cells. While not a mainstream material, GaS is the subject of ongoing research aimed at uncovering its full potential for optoelectronic applications.
