<h1>Gadolinium scandium aluminium garnet, Gd<sub>3</sub>Sc<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (GSAG)</h1>

Gadolinium scandium aluminium garnet (Gd<sub>3</sub>Sc<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, or GSAG) is a synthetic garnet crystal known for its excellent thermal properties and broad transparency range in the visible and near-infrared regions. This material has a refractive index of around 1.97 in the 632.8 nm wavelength and is characterized by its thermal and mechanical robustness. GSAG serves as a substrate for the epitaxial growth of other garnet crystals and is also utilized in high-temperature applications. The material's stability and favorable optical properties make it a candidate for use in various optical components, such as laser hosts and optical isolators, particularly in systems that operate under demanding conditions.
