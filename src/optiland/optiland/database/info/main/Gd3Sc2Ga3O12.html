<h1>Gadolinium scandium gallium garnet, Gd<sub>3</sub>Sc<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (GSGG)</h1>

Gadolinium scandium gallium garnet (Gd<sub>3</sub>Sc<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, or GSGG) is a synthetic crystalline material renowned for its exceptional thermo-optical properties and broad transparency range in the visible to near-infrared spectrum. With a refractive index of approximately 1.97 at 632.8 nm, GSGG exhibits excellent thermal stability and mechanical robustness. This material is often used as a laser host crystal for neodymium-doped solid-state lasers and other high-power laser applications. Its thermal and optical characteristics make it ideal for use in advanced optical systems, including those deployed in high-stress environments. GSGG can also serve as a substrate for the epitaxial growth of other garnet structures.
