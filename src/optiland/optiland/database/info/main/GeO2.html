<h1>Germanium dioxide, GeO<sub>2</sub></h1>

Germanium dioxide (GeO<sub>2</sub>) is often encountered in crystalline forms, which are transparent in the ultraviolet and infrared regions of the spectrum. This material is important in optical applications like fiber optic systems, where it is used as a dopant to adjust the refractive index of silica fibers. The compound can exist in multiple polymorphs, including hexagonal and tetragonal forms, each with their own set of optical and mechanical properties. It's also a precursor for producing high-purity germanium for use in semiconductors.
