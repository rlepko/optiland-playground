<h1>Indium, In</h1>

Indium (In) is a soft, malleable metal that is primarily used in the electronics industry for making semiconductors, transistors, and a variety of other components. In the realm of optics, indium is often employed in the fabrication of photodetectors and infrared sensors due to its unique electronic properties. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conductive oxide that serves as a popular material for making touch screens, LED displays, and solar cells. Indium is also frequently used to create low-melting alloys for a variety of other technological applications. Despite its widespread use, indium is relatively rare and expensive. Precautions should be taken when handling indium compounds due to potential toxicity.
