<h1>Indium antimonide, InSb</h1>

Indium antimonide (InSb) is a III-V compound semiconductor with a zinc blende crystal structure. It possesses a very narrow energy band gap and high electron mobility, which make it particularly useful in infrared detectors and infrared astronomy applications. The material is highly sensitive to temperature variations, a factor that must be accounted for in device design and operation. In addition to its utility in photodetectors, it is employed in Hall effect devices due to its excellent mobility properties. Its high electron mobility also makes it suitable for high-frequency and high-performance transistors. Indium antimonide wafers are typically grown using liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and device fabrication often utilizes metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Like many semiconductor materials, InSb must be handled carefully due to toxicity concerns.
