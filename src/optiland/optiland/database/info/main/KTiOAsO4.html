<h1>Potassium titanyl arsenate (KTiOAsO<sub>4</sub>, KTA)</h1>

Potassium titanyl arsenate (KTiOAsO<sub>4</sub>, abbreviated as KTA) is a nonlinear optical crystal that is commonly used for frequency-doubling and -tripling applications, as well as for optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). This material offers a broad transparency range, extending from the visible to the mid-infrared spectrum. Its phase-matching capability allows for versatile tunability, making it highly desirable for use in various laser systems and other optical devices. KTA is particularly advantageous when used in high-power and high-repetition-rate laser systems due to its high damage threshold. However, it should be noted that the material contains arsenic and should be handled with appropriate safety precautions.
