<h1>Potassium yttrium tungstate, KY(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (Yb:KYW)</h1>

Potassium yttrium tungstate doped with Ytterbium (KY(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, commonly abbreviated as Yb:KYW) is a solid-state laser crystal material notable for its broad emission and absorption spectra, high efficiency, and versatility in ultrafast laser applications. It is frequently used as a gain medium in diode-pumped solid-state lasers. The crystal structure of KYW allows for a wide range of doping with rare-earth ions like Ytterbium (Yb), making it a good candidate for tunable laser sources. It also possesses a wide transparency range and high thermal conductivity, making it suitable for high-power applications. One of the distinctive features of Yb:KYW is its strong polarization dependence, which can be an advantage in some applications requiring polarization control. Given its suite of advantageous properties, Yb:KYW has garnered significant attention in the realm of ultrafast and tunable laser systems.
