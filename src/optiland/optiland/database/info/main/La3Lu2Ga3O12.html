<h1>Lanthanum lutetium gallium garnet, La<sub>3</sub>Lu<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLGG)</h1>


Lanthanum lutetium gallium garnet (La<sub>3</sub>Lu<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, commonly abbreviated as LLGG) is a synthetic crystalline material that possesses desirable optical properties, including high thermal stability and a wide transparency range. It is particularly useful in optical isolators and other non-linear optical applications, owing to its high resistance to laser-induced damage. LLGG can be used as a substrate for various thin-film optical devices and serves as an alternative to other garnet-type materials in laser applications. With its combination of thermal and optical properties, LLGG is a material of interest for both research and practical applications in the fields of photonics and optoelectronics.
