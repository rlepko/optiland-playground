<h1>Lithium bromide, LiBr</h1>

Lithium bromide (LiBr) is a salt that is most commonly used as a desiccant in air-conditioning systems. It is highly hygroscopic, easily absorbing water from the air. In the realm of optics, it is used less frequently but can serve as a transparent material in the infrared range. LiBr is soluble in water, alcohol, and other polar solvents, and it is generally not suitable for high-power optical applications due to its hygroscopic nature, which can lead to degradation over time when exposed to moisture.
