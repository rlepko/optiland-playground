<h1>Lithium iodate, LiIO<sub>3</sub></h1>

Lithium iodate (LiIO<sub>3</sub>) is a white crystalline compound that has nonlinear optical properties, making it useful in certain optical applications such as frequency conversion and electro-optical modulation. Due to its good phase-matching capabilities, it is often employed in second harmonic generation (SHG) and other nonlinear optical processes. Lithium iodate is also characterized by its relatively high damage threshold, which makes it suitable for high-power optical systems. However, the compound is sensitive to moisture and must be handled and stored under controlled conditions to maintain its optical characteristics.
