<h1>Lithium niobate, LiNbO<sub>3</sub></h1>

Lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>) is a ferroelectric material with excellent electro-optic, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical properties. It is widely used in integrated optics, optoelectronic devices, and telecommunication applications. LiNbO<sub>3</sub> crystals are often employed in modulators, switches, waveguide devices, and frequency doublers. Due to its strong Pockels effect, it is a popular choice for Q-switching in solid-state lasers and is a key material in the fabrication of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. The material is generally transparent in the wide wavelength range from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet, making it versatile for various optical applications.
