<h1>Lithium tantalate, LiTaO<sub>3</sub></h1>

Lithium Tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) is a crystalline compound known for its unique electro-optical, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties. As a result of these characteristics, LiTaO<sub>3</sub> has become highly sought after in various applications. It is often used in non-linear optics for frequency doubling of lasers, and its acoustic properties make it an attractive material for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Moreover, LiTaO<sub>3</sub> is widely used in the fabrication of acoustic wave filters in telecommunications. The crystal can also serve as a substrate for the growth of other materials in research and fabrication applications. One of the standout properties of LiTaO<sub>3</sub> is its ability to modulate light, making it a key player in modern electro-optical modulators. While handling, it is important to be aware of the potential hazards associated with lithium compounds; thus, proper safety protocols should be followed. Optically, the crystal's refractive properties are essential for numerous photonics applications.
