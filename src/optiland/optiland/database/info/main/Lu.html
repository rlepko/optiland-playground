<h1>Lutetium, Lu</h1>

Lutetium is a silvery-white metal and the last element in the lanthanide series. While it's not as widely known or used as some other rare earth elements, it has found niche applications in the modern technological and scientific domains. Optically, lutetium aluminate (LuAlO<sub>3</sub>) and lutetium orthosilicate (LSO) are two materials containing lutetium that are frequently employed in scintillator applications, particularly in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The high atomic number of lutetium contributes to its effective detection of gamma rays.
