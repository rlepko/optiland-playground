<h1>Lutetium aluminium garnet, Lu<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LuAG)</h1>

Lutetium aluminium garnet (Lu<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, or LuAG) is a synthetic garnet crystal. Owing to its outstanding properties, such as high density, high thermal conductivity, and good transparency in the visible and near-infrared regions, it's widely used in scintillator applications for high-energy photon detection. Additionally, LuAG has been studied as a potential host material for solid-state lasers, particularly when doped with rare-earth ions. Its transparency and luminescent characteristics make it valuable in various optical and photonic devices.
