<h1>Lutetium aluminium borate, LuAl<sub>3</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (LuAB)</h1>

Lutetium aluminium borate (LuAl<sub>3</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, or LuAB) is a synthetic crystal material known for its non-linear optical properties. With a high damage threshold and phase matching capabilities, it has potential in frequency conversion applications, especially in the deep ultraviolet to infrared spectrum. Additionally, when doped with certain rare-earth ions, LuAB can serve as a luminescent material. Its unique combination of properties makes it an attractive choice for various optical devices and systems, especially where high-power laser interactions are involved.
