<h1>Magnesium hydride, MgH<sub>2</sub></h1>

Magnesium hydride (MgH<sub>2</sub>) is a solid compound consisting of magnesium and hydrogen. It is known primarily for its potential use as a hydrogen storage material. When heated, MgH<sub>2</sub> decomposes to release hydrogen gas, making it of interest for hydrogen storage and production technologies. Optically, MgH<sub>2</sub> is generally not transparent and doesn't have widespread use in conventional optical applications. However, research into its optical properties might become relevant in the context of its potential use in energy storage and conversion systems.
