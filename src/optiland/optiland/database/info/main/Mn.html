<h1>Manganese, Mn</h1>

Manganese (Mn) is a transition metal with a silvery-gray appearance. It's essential in the steel industry, where it is used primarily as an alloying agent, enhancing strength, hardness, and wear resistance. In terms of optical applications, manganese can be used as a dopant in various phosphorescent and fluorescent materials, altering their luminescent properties. For instance, manganese-doped zinc sulfide is a popular phosphor, emitting a distinct orange-red light upon excitation.
