<h1>Molybdenum trioxide, MoO<sub>3</sub></h1>

Molybdenum trioxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>) is a compound of molybdenum and oxygen. It appears as an odorless, light-colored crystalline solid. It is a primary component in the production of molybdenum metal. In the field of optics, thin films of MoO<sub>3</sub> can be deposited on various substrates, serving as layers in certain optoelectronic devices due to its semiconducting properties. The compound is also investigated for potential uses in energy storage and sensor applications. Additionally, its transparency to infrared radiation makes it a candidate for specific optical applications in the IR range.
