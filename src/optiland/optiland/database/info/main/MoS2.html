<h1>Molybdenum disulfide, MoS<sub>2</sub></h1>

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) is a naturally occurring, dark gray or black compound that feels similar to graphite. This similarity is due to its layered structure where each molybdenum atom is sandwiched between two sulfur atoms in a trigonal prismatic coordination. The layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces, allowing them to easily slide over each other. This property renders MoS<sub>2</sub> useful as a lubricant in various applications. Optically, MoS<sub>2</sub> has gained significant attention because, when exfoliated to single layers, it behaves as a direct bandgap semiconductor, making it highly relevant for optoelectronic devices. Thin layers of MoS<sub>2</sub> have been investigated for their use in transistors, sensors, and other nanoscale devices due to their unique electronic and optical properties.
