<h1>Molybdenum diselenide, MoSe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe<sub>2</sub>) is a layered compound similar in structure to molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>). Each layer consists of a plane of molybdenum atoms sandwiched between two planes of selenium atoms. These layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces, allowing them to be easily exfoliated. In its bulk form, MoSe<sub>2</sub> behaves as an indirect bandgap semiconductor. However, when reduced to a monolayer, its properties shift, and it becomes a direct bandgap semiconductor. This transition in electronic properties has attracted considerable interest in the fields of optoelectronics and nanotechnology. Potential applications include use in transistors, photodetectors, and other electronic or optoelectronic devices, especially when high-quality thin films or single layers are employed.
