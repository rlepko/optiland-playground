<h1>Molybdenum ditelluride, MoTe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe<sub>2</sub>) is a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family, characterized by its layered structure. Each layer comprises a plane of molybdenum atoms situated between two planes of tellurium atoms. These layers are bound by weak van der Waals forces, enabling easy exfoliation into individual layers or few-layered structures. Like other TMDs, MoTe<sub>2</sub> undergoes a change in electronic properties when thinned down to a monolayer; it transitions from an indirect to a direct bandgap semiconductor. Due to this unique property and its high electron mobility, MoTe<sub>2</sub> is a material of significant interest in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and for potential applications in field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and other advanced electronic devices.
