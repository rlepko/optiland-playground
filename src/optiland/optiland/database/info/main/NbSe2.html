<h1>Niobium diselenide, NbSe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Niobium diselenide (NbSe<sub>2</sub>) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide with intriguing electronic and optical properties. Due to its layered structure, NbSe<sub>2</sub> can be exfoliated into ultra-thin sheets, similarly to graphene, which are of interest in nanoscale devices. One of the notable properties of NbSe<sub>2</sub> is its superconductivity at low temperatures. Additionally, research has shown that this material possesses charge-density wave phases, making it a subject of interest for understanding correlated electron systems. In the realm of optics, the material's nonlinear optical properties are being explored for potential applications in photonics and optoelectronics.
