<h1>Lead, Pb</h1>

Lead (Pb) is a heavy metal that is known for its malleability, ductility, and resistance to corrosion. Historically, lead has had various applications including in batteries, pipes, cable sheathing, and as a radiation shield. In terms of optics, lead has been utilized in the manufacture of certain types of optical glasses, known as flint glasses. These glasses have high refractive indices and dispersive power. Lead-based glasses have been traditionally used in lenses and prisms to correct chromatic aberration in optical systems. However, the use of lead in consumer products has decreased significantly due to environmental and health concerns. In many regions, regulations have limited the use of lead in electronics and other products.
