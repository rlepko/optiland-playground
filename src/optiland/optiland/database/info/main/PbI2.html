<h1>Lead iodide, PbI<sub>2</sub></h1>

Lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>) is a crystalline compound that displays distinct yellow coloration. This compound has drawn interest in the field of optoelectronics, particularly for its potential use in perovskite solar cells. When combined with organic molecules, PbI<sub>2</sub> forms hybrid perovskites, which have garnered attention for their impressive photovoltaic properties and their potential to revolutionize solar cell technology. Additionally, due to its heavy atom nature, lead iodide can act as a scintillator, making it useful in radiation detection applications. As with other lead compounds, care should be exercised when working with PbI<sub>2</sub> because of its toxicity.
