<h1>Palladium, Pd</h1>

Palladium (Pd) is a lustrous silvery-white metal that belongs to the platinum group metals (PGMs). It is renowned for its outstanding catalytic properties, especially in hydrogenation reactions. Due to its ability to readily absorb hydrogen, palladium serves as an essential component in hydrogen storage and purification technologies. In the electronics sector, palladium is used for plating connectors, primarily because of its excellent conductivity and resistance to oxidation. Additionally, Pd-based compounds and alloys find applications in jewelry, dentistry, and the production of certain types of fuel cells. In the optical domain, thin palladium films can serve as semi-transparent coatings, allowing for specific optical behaviors such as controlled reflectivity.
