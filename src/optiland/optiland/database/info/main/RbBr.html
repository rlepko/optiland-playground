<h1>Rubidium bromide, RbBr</h1>

Rubidium bromide (RbBr) is an ionic compound consisting of rubidium cations (Rb<sup>+</sup>) and bromide anions (Br<sup>-</sup>). This white, crystalline solid is highly soluble in water, producing a solution that is neutral in pH. Like other alkali metal bromides, rubidium bromide is typically used in the laboratory setting rather than for commercial applications. Due to its optical properties, it may be of interest in certain optical and laser applications. In general, RbBr shares many of the properties common to other alkali metal bromides, such as high solubility in water, hygroscopic nature, and good conductivity when dissolved or melted. Handling should be done with care as it reacts with moisture and can be corrosive.
