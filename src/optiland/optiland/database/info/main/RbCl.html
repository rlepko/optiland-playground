<h1>Rubidium chloride, RbCl</h1>

Rubidium chloride (RbCl) is a white crystalline compound composed of rubidium cations (Rb<sup>+</sup>) and chloride anions (Cl<sup>-</sup>). It is highly soluble in water, producing a neutral solution. RbCl is commonly used in laboratories, especially in biochemical research as a source of rubidium ions, which have been used in various physiological studies. The compound shares many properties with other alkali metal chlorides, such as high solubility in water and a hygroscopic nature. It also has potential use in some optical and electronic applications. Due to its reactivity, especially with moisture, precautions should be taken when handling and storing this compound.
