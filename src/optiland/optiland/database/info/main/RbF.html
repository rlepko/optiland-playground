<h1>Rubidium fluoride, RbF</h1>

Rubidium fluoride (RbF) is a chemical compound formed by the union of rubidium cations (Rb<sup>+</sup>) and fluoride anions (F<sup>-</sup>). The compound manifests as a white or colorless crystalline solid. Like other alkali metal fluorides, RbF is highly soluble in water. In laboratories, rubidium fluoride is utilized mainly for research purposes, particularly in the synthesis of other rubidium-containing compounds. Owing to its high reactivity, especially when exposed to moisture or water, it's essential to handle and store RbF with care, typically under an inert atmosphere or in a desiccated environment.
