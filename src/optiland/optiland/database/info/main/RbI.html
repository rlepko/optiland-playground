<h1>Rubidium iodide, RbI</h1>

Rubidium iodide (RbI) is a chemical compound formed by combining rubidium cations (Rb<sup>+</sup>) with iodide anions (I<sup>-</sup>). It appears as white or colorless crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water, similar to other alkali metal iodides. In the laboratory, rubidium iodide is used primarily for research purposes, especially in the preparation of other rubidium-based compounds. Due to its high solubility and reactivity, especially with moisture, it should be handled with care and stored in dry conditions or under an inert atmosphere to prevent decomposition or reactions.
