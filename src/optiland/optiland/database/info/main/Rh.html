<h1>Rhodium, Rh</h1>

Rhodium (Rh) is a rare, silvery-white, hard metal that is part of the platinum group metals (PGMs). With its impressive resistance to corrosion and oxidation, rhodium is often used as a catalyst in the chemical industry, especially in automotive catalytic converters to reduce harmful emissions. Additionally, due to its high reflectance, rhodium finds use in mirrors and searchlights. The metal is also employed in jewelry, typically as plating for white gold and silver, given its ability to impart a bright and durable finish. In electronics, rhodium is used in electrical contacts because of its low electrical resistance and exceptional wear resistance. Owing to its scarcity and the complex process of mining, rhodium is usually more expensive than gold or platinum.
