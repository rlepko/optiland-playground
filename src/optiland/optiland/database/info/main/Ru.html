<h1>Ruthenium, Ru</h1>

Ruthenium (Ru) is a rare transition metal that belongs to the platinum group of the periodic table. Exhibiting a shiny, silvery appearance, ruthenium is known for its impressive hardness and resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures. In the electronics industry, ruthenium is utilized as a crucial component for some types of resistors and capacitors. Additionally, its catalytic properties make it valuable in the chemical industry, especially for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Ruthenium oxide is used in supercapacitors due to its high charge storage capacity. Moreover, in the realm of jewelry, ruthenium is often alloyed with platinum and palladium to enhance their hardness and wear resistance. Recently, ruthenium-based compounds have also been explored for potential applications in cancer therapy and solar energy conversion.
