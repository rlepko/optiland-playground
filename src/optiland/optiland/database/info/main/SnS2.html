<h1>Tin disulfide, SnS<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tin disulfide (SnS<sub>2</sub>) is a layered material with a hexagonal crystal structure. It is an n-type semiconductor and exhibits a direct bandgap, making it of interest for optoelectronic applications. Due to its semiconducting nature, it has potential uses in photodetectors, solar cells, and field-effect transistors. Additionally, SnS<sub>2</sub> has shown promise in the field of energy storage and can be employed as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries. The layered structure of SnS<sub>2</sub> also means that it can be exfoliated into thin layers or nanosheets, similar to graphene, enabling its use in the growing field of two-dimensional materials for next-generation devices.
