<h1>Tin diselenide, SnSe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tin diselenide (SnSe<sub>2</sub>) is a layered, semiconducting material with a hexagonal crystal structure. SnSe<sub>2</sub> belongs to the group of metal dichalcogenides, a family of two-dimensional (2D) materials similar to transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS<sub>2</sub>. As a 2D material, SnSe<sub>2</sub> can be exfoliated into thin layers or even monolayers. Its direct bandgap and strong light-matter interaction have spurred interest in potential optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and field-effect transistors. Additionally, due to its unique electronic and mechanical properties, SnSe<sub>2</sub> is also investigated for potential uses in nanoelectronic devices and as a thermoelectric material.
