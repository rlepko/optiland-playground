<h1>Strontium, Sr</h1>

Strontium (Sr) is a soft, silver-white alkaline earth metal that is found naturally in minerals like celestine and strontianite. While it is reactive with air and water, it is not as reactive as its periodic table neighbors like calcium or magnesium. Strontium has several isotopes, and its radioactive isotope, strontium-90, is a byproduct of nuclear reactions and poses health concerns due to its high-energy beta decay. Commercially, strontium is often used in the production of CRT glass for television tubes, as it blocks radiation. Furthermore, it has applications in pyrotechnics for the red flame in fireworks and flares. Strontium also has roles in medical applications; for example, the isotope strontium-89 is used in targeted therapies for bone cancers. Strontium compounds, like strontium ranelate, have been studied for potential use in osteoporosis treatments.
