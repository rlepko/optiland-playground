<h1>Strontium titanate, SrTiO<sub>3</sub></h1>

Strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) is a crystalline solid that is often transparent or pale yellow. It possesses perovskite structure and has garnered significant attention in the field of materials science and solid-state physics due to its intriguing dielectric, ferroelectric, and optical properties. SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is widely used as a substrate material for growing high-temperature superconductors, magnetic films, and other oxide thin films. Its high refractive index has also made it popular as a diamond simulant in jewelry, although this use has decreased in favor of more modern materials. In addition, it's used in electronics as a high-k dielectric in DRAM capacitors. The compound can be naturally found in a mineral called perovskite, but most commercial SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is synthetically produced.
