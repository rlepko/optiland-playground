<h1>Tantalum disulfide, TaS<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tantalum disulfide (TaS<sub>2</sub>) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide with intriguing electrical and optical properties. It's known for its charge density wave (CDW) transitions, which can lead to various electronic states, such as metallic, insulating, and superconducting phases. This material is also of considerable interest in the research community for its potential in miniaturized electronic devices and as a platform for studying correlated electron systems. The thin layers of TaS<sub>2</sub> can be exfoliated, making it a candidate for use in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic applications. The compound's unique electronic properties also make it a subject of interest in the exploration of novel quantum phenomena.
