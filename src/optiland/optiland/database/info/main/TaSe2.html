<h1>Tantalum diselenide, TaSe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tantalum diselenide (TaSe<sub>2</sub>) is a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family, possessing unique electrical and optical characteristics. Like its sulfide counterpart, TaSe<sub>2</sub> undergoes charge density wave (CDW) transitions, leading to complex electronic behaviors such as superconductivity in certain conditions. The material's layered structure allows for exfoliation into thin sheets, paving the way for potential applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Furthermore, TaSe<sub>2</sub>'s intriguing properties, including its responses to external stimuli like pressure and field, make it a popular candidate for studying exotic quantum states and phase transitions.
