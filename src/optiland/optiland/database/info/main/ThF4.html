<h1>Thorium tetrafluoride, ThF<sub>4</sub></h1>

Thorium tetrafluoride (ThF<sub>4</sub>) is a white crystalline solid and is one of the principal halide compounds of thorium. Due to its high melting point and low refractive index, it has been investigated as a potential material for optical windows, especially in the infrared range. ThF<sub>4</sub> has been found to possess favorable transmission properties in the mid and far-infrared spectrum, making it suitable for some infrared optics applications. Furthermore, as with many thorium compounds, it is radioactive because thorium is predominantly found as the isotope Th-232, which decays over time. Handling and use of ThF<sub>4</sub> therefore require precautions to protect against radiation exposure. The compound also serves as an intermediate in the processing of thorium from its ores and can be a precursor to other thorium compounds in various chemical processes.
