<h1>Titanium, Ti</h1>

Titanium (Ti) is a transition metal with the atomic number 22. It is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. With a silver color and low density, titanium is as strong as some steels but significantly less dense. This makes it highly valued in aerospace applications where weight savings are crucial. Titanium is also biocompatible, which makes it a critical material for medical implants such as hip replacements and dental implants. The metal is also found in everyday products like tennis rackets, eyeglass frames, and even some laptops. Titanium can be alloyed with elements like aluminum and vanadium to further enhance its properties. Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), one of its compounds, is widely used as a white pigment in paints and is an active ingredient in sunscreens due to its UV-blocking properties.
