<h1>Titanium carbide, TiC</h1>

Titanium carbide (TiC) is a hard, refractory ceramic material, often used in combination with other carbides. It's characterized by its excellent hardness, good wear resistance, and high melting point. With its metallic luster, TiC can be polished to a high reflectance. Because of these properties, it's frequently found in tool bits for cutting tools and abrasives. It also exhibits good thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, which is uncommon for most ceramics. In the realm of electronics, titanium carbide can be utilized as a thin film resistor. When combined with other materials, like nickel, it can be used in the manufacturing of cermets, which possess properties of both metals and ceramics and find applications in various cutting tools.
