<h1>Titanium dioxide, TiO<sub>2</sub></h1>

Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is a naturally occurring oxide of titanium. It possesses a high refractive index, making it an important material in optical coatings and components, especially as a white pigment in paints, cosmetics, and sunscreens due to its UV absorbing properties. The two main crystal forms used in industry are the rutile and anatase forms. Additionally, its photovoltaic and photocatalytic properties have led to research and applications in solar cells and air purification, respectively. TiO<sub>2</sub> also has a robust chemical stability under various conditions, which makes it a preferred material for use in harsh environments.
