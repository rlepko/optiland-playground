<h1>Thallium chloride, TlCl</h1>

Thallium chloride (TlCl) is a crystalline compound that exhibits properties suitable for specific applications, particularly in infrared detection. With its wide bandgap, TlCl is transparent in the mid-infrared region, making it useful as an optical window material for infrared sensors and other related devices. Furthermore, thallium-based compounds, including TlCl, have been explored for their potential in radiation detection due to the high atomic number of thallium. However, just like other thallium compounds, it is essential to handle TlCl with care because of the inherent toxicity of thallium.
