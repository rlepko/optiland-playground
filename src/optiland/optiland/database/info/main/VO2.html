<h1>Vanadium dioxide, VO<sub>2</sub></h1>

Vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) is a unique compound with a characteristic metal-insulator transition. At temperatures below 67Â°C, VO<sub>2</sub> acts as an insulator but rapidly becomes a conductor when heated above this threshold. This swift phase transition is accompanied by a structural change from a monoclinic to a tetragonal lattice. Because of this distinctive property, VO<sub>2</sub> has garnered significant attention for potential applications in electronics, particularly as a switch or in thermochromic devices. For example, its use in smart windows allows for the regulation of infrared radiation, enabling energy savings by blocking heat during summer or retaining it during winter. Furthermore, researchers have been exploring its potential in high-frequency electronics and optoelectronic devices.
