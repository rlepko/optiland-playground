<h1>Tungsten, W</h1>

Tungsten, commonly known by its chemical symbol W (derived from its alternative name, wolfram), is a hard, dense metal with a bright silver-gray luster. Known for its high melting point, which is the highest of all the elements at 3,422°C (6,192°F), tungsten is often used in applications that require materials that can withstand extreme temperatures. Historically, it's been a crucial component in the filaments of incandescent light bulbs. Moreover, tungsten and its alloys are utilized in many high-temperature structural materials, particularly in aerospace and electronic industries due to their remarkable strength at elevated temperatures. Tungsten is also used in the production of wear-resistant electrical contacts and as the primary component in certain types of heavy metal alloys. In the realm of optics and photonics, tungsten is often used as a target for X-ray generation.
