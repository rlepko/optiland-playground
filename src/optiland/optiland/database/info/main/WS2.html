<h1>Tungsten disulfide, WS<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide that possesses distinct properties based on its structural morphology. In its three-dimensional bulk form, WS<sub>2</sub> has indirect bandgap semiconducting properties, which contrasts its behavior when isolated to a monolayer or few-layer forms. When exfoliated to these thin layers, WS<sub>2</sub> undergoes a transition to a direct bandgap semiconductor, making it intriguing for potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. This material's unique hexagonal structure gives it excellent lubrication capabilities, often preferred in environments with high pressures and temperatures. Furthermore, research continues into its promise in nanoelectronic devices, spintronic applications, and as a component in heterostructures with other two-dimensional materials.
