<h1>Tungsten diselenide, WSe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) is a member of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family, known for its distinctive layered structure. The individual layers are bound by weak van der Waals interactions, allowing for exfoliation into atomically thin sheets. In its monolayer form, WSe<sub>2</sub> possesses a direct bandgap, distinguishing it from its bulk indirect bandgap property. This unique characteristic renders WSe<sub>2</sub> as a prime candidate for optoelectronic applications, including photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and even photovoltaic devices. It has also been explored in the fabrication of field-effect transistors and quantum devices. The intriguing electronic and optical attributes of WSe<sub>2</sub>, especially when interfaced with other 2D materials, have garnered significant attention in advanced materials research.
