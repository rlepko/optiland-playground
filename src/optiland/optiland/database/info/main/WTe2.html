<h1>Tungsten ditelluride, WTe<sub>2</sub></h1>

Tungsten ditelluride (WTe<sub>2</sub>) is a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) group, possessing unique electronic properties that set it apart from other TMDs. Characterized by its layered structure, the layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces, making it possible to exfoliate into ultra-thin layers. WTe<sub>2</sub> has gained significant attention due to its extremely large magnetoresistance and the discovery of type-II Weyl semimetal state in its structure. The combination of these unusual properties has spurred interest in its potential for advanced electronic, spintronic, and quantum devices. Moreover, its inherent flexibility in thin layers can be advantageous for future wearable or flexible device applications.
