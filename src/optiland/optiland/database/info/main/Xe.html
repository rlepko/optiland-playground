<h1>Xenon, Xe</h1>

Xenon (Xe) is a noble gas that exists as a colorless, dense, odorless gas under standard conditions. It's one of the rare gases found in the Earth's atmosphere, representing only a tiny fraction of the air we breathe. Due to its heavy atomic weight and low reactivity, xenon is often used in specialized lighting, including powerful flash lamps, high-intensity arc-lamps, and as the propellant in ion engines for deep space missions. In medicine, xenon has been explored as an anesthetic and in imaging. Its isotopes also find use in various applications, such as the detection of neutrinos in particle physics experiments. Xenon can form compounds, albeit rarely, with highly electronegative elements like fluorine.
