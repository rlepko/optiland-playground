<h1>Yttrium sesquioxide, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></h1>

Yttrium sesquioxide (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), also known as yttria, is a white crystalline compound that is one of the most stable of the rare earth oxides. With a high melting point and a unique refractive index, yttria is commonly used as a stabilizing agent for zirconia in the production of various ceramic materials, particularly those used for high-temperature applications. Its excellent thermal stability and resistance to chemical attack make it valuable in the production of refractories, crucibles, and ceramic coatings exposed to high temperatures. Additionally, yttrium oxide is used in the manufacture of yttrium-iron garnets (YIGs), which have applications in microwave filters and resonators. The material also serves as a host lattice for phosphors in television tubes and white LEDs.
