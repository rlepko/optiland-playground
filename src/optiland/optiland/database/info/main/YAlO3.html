<h1>Yttrium orthoaluminate, YAlO<sub>3</sub> (YAP)</h1>

Yttrium orthoaluminate (YAlO<sub>3</sub>, often abbreviated as YAP) is a crystalline material characterized by its orthorhombic crystal structure. Due to its favorable mechanical and optical properties, YAP is frequently employed in the field of optics. It offers a broad transparency range, making it suitable for various laser applications, especially when doped with certain rare-earth ions like neodymium. The doping can enable efficient laser emission and amplification in specific wavelength regions. In addition to its optical applications, YAP, when doped with certain activators, can serve as a scintillator material, translating high-energy radiation into visible light. Its stability, durability, and potential for doping make YAP a valuable material in both research and industrial contexts.
