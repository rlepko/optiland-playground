<h1>Yttrium orthovanadate, YVO<sub>4</sub></h1>

Yttrium orthovanadate (YVO<sub>4</sub>) is a crystalline material known for its outstanding optical properties. It serves as a prominent choice for optical applications, especially as a laser host crystal. When doped with specific rare-earth ions like neodymium (Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>), it becomes a popular solid-state laser medium due to its high gain, low lasing threshold, and high efficiency. YVO<sub>4</sub> also exhibits excellent birefringence, which makes it suitable for frequency doubling and other nonlinear optical processes. The material boasts a broad transparency range, from the visible to the near-infrared spectrum. Its high index of refraction enables tight focusing of light, beneficial in certain optical systems. In its pure form, YVO<sub>4</sub> is transparent and colorless.
