<h1>Zinc germanium phosphide, ZnGeP<sub>2</sub> (ZGP)</h1>

Zinc germanium phosphide (ZnGeP<sub>2</sub>, ZGP), is a non-linear optical material that has been widely used for frequency conversion in the mid-infrared range. It possesses a broad transparency range, high damage threshold, and phase-matching capabilities, making it a favored choice for a variety of laser applications. Owing to its ability to efficiently generate coherent radiation in the 2 to 12 Âµm spectral range, ZGP is especially relevant for molecular spectroscopy, environmental monitoring, and medical surgery. As a non-centrosymmetric crystal, ZGP can be employed for second harmonic generation, parametric oscillation, and other non-linear processes when exposed to suitable pump sources.
