<h1>Acetonitrile, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N</h1>

Acetonitrile (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N): A colorless, volatile liquid, acetonitrile possesses a faintly sweet odor reminiscent of almonds. Widely used as a solvent, it has a high dielectric constant and is particularly effective in the dissolution of ionic compounds. In the laboratory, it is commonly employed as a polar aprotic solvent in organic synthesis and chromatographic processes, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Acetonitrile is also utilized in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and rubber products. Its low UV absorbance makes it valuable in UV-visible spectroscopy applications. The compound is miscible with water and most common organic solvents.
