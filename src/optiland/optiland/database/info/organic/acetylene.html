<h1>Acetylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (HCCH)</h1>

Acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), often represented as HCâ‰¡CH, is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne. It's a colorless gas under normal conditions and has a distinctive garlic-like odor. Acetylene is a key component for oxy-acetylene welding due to its ability to produce an extremely hot flame when combined with oxygen. This gas is also utilized in the production of various organic chemicals and the synthesis of polyethylene plastics and acrylics. Its linear structure confers a high degree of unsaturation, making it reactive in many chemical processes.
