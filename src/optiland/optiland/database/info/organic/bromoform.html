<h1>Bromoform, CHBr<sub>3</sub></h1>

Bromoform (CHBr<sub>3</sub>) is a dense, colorless to pale-yellow liquid that has a high refractive index and emits a sweet odor similar to that of chloroform. It is one of the trihalomethanes, with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. Historically, bromoform was used as a solvent, sedative, and flame retardant, but due to its potential health risks and environmental concerns, its use has been largely restricted in many countries. It can be produced as a byproduct during the chlorination of drinking water that contains bromide ions. Exposure to bromoform can be harmful, and it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen based on animal studies.
