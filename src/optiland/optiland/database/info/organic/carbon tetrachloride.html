<h1>Carbon chloride, CCl<sub>4</sub></h1>

Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>), also known as tetrachloromethane, is a colorless, dense, and non-flammable liquid with a sweet, characteristic odor. Historically, it was widely used as a cleaning agent, refrigerant, and in fire extinguishers, but due to its harmful environmental and health effects, many of these applications have been phased out. 
Carbon tetrachloride is a potent liver toxin when ingested and can lead to severe liver damage or even death in high doses. It's also a confirmed carcinogen and can cause harm to the central nervous system. In the environment, carbon tetrachloride can deplete the ozone layer when released into the atmosphere. Due to these concerns, its production and usage in many consumer applications have been restricted under various international agreements. In industry, carbon tetrachloride is used in the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and as a feedstock in certain chemical manufacturing processes. It's also utilized as a solvent in laboratories and in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.
