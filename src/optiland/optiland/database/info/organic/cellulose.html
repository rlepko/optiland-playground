<h1>Cellulose, (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub></h1>

Cellulose (<i>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub></i>) is an organic compound and the primary constituent of cell walls in green plants, many forms of algae, and oomycetes. Being the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, it serves as a primary source of nutrition for herbivores through a process called cellulolysis. Composed of linear chains of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units, it differs from starch, another glucose-based polymer, in that humans and many animals cannot directly digest cellulose due to its β-glycosidic bonds. However, certain animals like ruminants and termites can break it down with the help of symbiotic microorganisms. Industrially, cellulose is vital for producing paper and paperboard and serves as a raw material for derivative products such as cellophane and rayon. Its derivatives, including cellulose acetate and nitrate, find uses in coatings, inks, and more. Its renewable nature has also positioned cellulose as a potential resource for sustainable biofuel production.
