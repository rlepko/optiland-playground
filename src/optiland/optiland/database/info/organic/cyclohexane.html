<h1>Cyclohexane, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub></h1>

Cyclohexane (<i>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub></i>) is a cycloalkane and a colorless liquid with a characteristic musty odor. It is used as a nonpolar solvent in the chemical industry and is also a raw material for the industrial production of adipic acid and caprolactam, both of which are intermediates used in the production of nylon. Cyclohexane is notable for its conformational flexibility, and the molecule adopts a chair conformation, which minimizes the steric interactions between the hydrogen atoms. Given its nonpolarity, cyclohexane doesn't dissolve in polar solvents like water but mixes well with other nonpolar compounds.
