<h1>Diethyl phthalate, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (DEP)</h1>

Diethyl phthalate (<i>C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>4</sub></i>), often abbreviated as DEP, is a clear and odorless liquid commonly employed as a solvent and plasticizer. It is used to make plastics more flexible and is also found in a variety of personal care products, such as perfumes, lotions, and cosmetics, due to its ability to help products retain scents and extend their shelf life. Additionally, DEP can be found in some food packaging materials. It's worth noting that concerns have been raised about the potential health impacts of phthalates, leading to extensive research and regulatory review in numerous jurisdictions.
