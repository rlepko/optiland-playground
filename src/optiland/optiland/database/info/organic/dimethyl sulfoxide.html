<h1>Dimethyl sulfoxide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>OS (DMSO, Me2SO)</h1>

Dimethyl sulfoxide (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>OS, DMSO, Me2SO) is a highly polar organic solvent with a wide range of applications. It is a clear, colorless liquid that is miscible with many organic solvents and water. Due to its ability to penetrate biological membranes, DMSO is frequently used as a solvent in biological studies and as a carrier for drug delivery. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and has been used in various medical applications, such as a treatment for pain and inflammation associated with certain conditions. In the industrial sector, DMSO is used as a solvent in chemical reactions, and in the electronics industry, it serves as a photoresist stripper and cleaner.
