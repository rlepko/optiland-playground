<h1>Ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub></h1>

Ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) is a colorless, odorless, and flammable hydrocarbon gas that belongs to the alkane series. It is the second-largest component of natural gas and is often used as a fuel. In the petrochemical industry, ethane is primarily utilized as a feedstock for the production of ethylene, a key building block for various plastics and other chemicals. When subjected to extremely low temperatures or high pressures, ethane can be liquified, making it easier to transport and store. As a molecule, ethane is notable for its single bond between the two carbon atoms, representing a typical sigma bond in organic chemistry.
