<h1>Ethylene glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub></h1>

Ethylene glycol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a colorless, syrupy liquid with a sweet taste, though it is toxic if ingested. It is primarily used as an antifreeze in cooling and heating systems, thanks to its ability to lower the freezing point of water. Furthermore, ethylene glycol is a crucial precursor in the manufacture of polyester fibers and resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is extensively used for plastic bottles and textiles. Due to its hygroscopic nature, it is also utilized as a desiccant in gas drying systems and in the production of capacitors. However, due to its toxicity, there are strict regulations regarding its disposal and it should be handled with care.
