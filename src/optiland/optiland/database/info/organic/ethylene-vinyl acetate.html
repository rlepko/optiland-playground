<h1>Ethylene-vinyl acetate, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>n</sub>(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub> (EVA)</h1>

Ethylene-vinyl acetate (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>n</sub>(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub> (EVA) is a copolymer composed of ethylene and vinyl acetate. This versatile material is known for its excellent flexibility, resilience, clarity, and resistance to UV radiation. It's softer and more flexible than polyethylene and possesses a lower melting point. EVA's unique properties stem from its varied content of vinyl acetate (typically ranging from 5% to 50%), with higher content increasing its softness and flexibility. This copolymer is widely used in various applications including foam shoe soles, hot melt adhesives, films for packaging, and even toys. Its versatility extends to other specialized uses like solar panel encapsulation and as a component in biomedical devices due to its biocompatibility. EVA is also known for its ease of processing, making it a preferred material for various fabrication methods.
