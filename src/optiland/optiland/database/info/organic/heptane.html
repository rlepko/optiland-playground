<h1>Heptane, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub></h1>

Heptane (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) is a straight-chain alkane hydrocarbon. It is a clear, colorless liquid that is less dense than water and exhibits a characteristic odor reminiscent of petrol. Being flammable, it is used in many laboratory settings as a non-polar solvent for organic substances. Heptane is also employed as a fuel in various applications and forms a significant component of gasoline. Due to its non-polarity, it is unsuitable for dissolving polar compounds but works effectively with non-polar molecules. In the field of optics, heptane can be used in a variety of experiments and setups that require a liquid medium with specific refractive properties.
