<h1>Hexane, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub></h1>

Hexane (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) is an alkane hydrocarbon with a straight chain of six carbon atoms. It appears as a colorless liquid that has a mild, gasoline-like odor. Volatile and highly flammable, hexane is often utilized as a solvent in laboratories due to its capability to dissolve non-polar substances. In the industrial realm, hexane is frequently used in the extraction of vegetable oils from crops such as soybeans. Its low polarity makes it ineffective for dissolving polar compounds but efficient for non-polar molecules. In optics, hexane can serve as a medium in certain experimental setups, benefiting from its defined refractive properties.
