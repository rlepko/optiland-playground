<h1>Polychlorotrifluoroethylene, (C<sub>2</sub>ClF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> (PCTFE, PTFCE)</h1>

Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE, PTFCE, (C<sub>2</sub>ClF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>) is a high-performance fluoropolymer that blends the properties of both chlorine and fluorine atoms in its polymer chain. This unique combination results in a material with exceptional chemical resistance akin to other fluoropolymers, but with enhanced mechanical properties and low-temperature performance. Notably, PCTFE exhibits very low moisture absorption, near-zero gas permeability, and excellent resistance to oxidation, making it highly valuable in aerospace, cryogenic, and electronic applications. In the optical domain, its transparency in the visible spectrum coupled with its resistance to UV radiation makes it suitable for certain specialized optical elements, especially in environments where traditional polymers might degrade. Additionally, PCTFE's non-flammability and high dimensional stability further broaden its range of applications, from protective films in electronics to seals and gaskets in chemical processing equipment. The refractive properties of PCTFE are influenced by its unique molecular structure, which combines the best attributes of chlorinated and fluorinated polymers.
