<h1>Propylene glycol, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub></h1>

Propylene glycol (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a synthetic organic compound that is a colorless, nearly odorless, clear, viscous liquid with a faintly sweet taste. Often regarded as a safer alternative to ethylene glycol, it is miscible with a broad range of solvents including water, acetone, and chloroform. In industrial settings, propylene glycol is used as a moisturizer in cosmetics, as a food additive, in the manufacture of hydraulic fluids and as a coolant in liquid cooling systems. Pharmacologically, it's employed to help retain the moisture content in medicines and as a solvent for oral, injectable, and topical drugs. In the realm of optics, its refractive properties can be significant, especially when used as a matching or immersion fluid.
