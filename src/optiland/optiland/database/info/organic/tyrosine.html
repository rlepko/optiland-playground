<h1>Tyrosine, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></h1>

Tyrosine (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is a non-essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of proteins. Found in many high-protein food products like chicken, turkey, fish, milk, yogurt, nuts, beans, and cheese, it is vital for numerous bodily functions. Tyrosine is a precursor for neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Moreover, it is involved in the production of melanin – the pigment responsible for the color of skin and hair – and certain hormones like thyroid hormones. From an optical standpoint, tyrosine exhibits specific optical properties, such as characteristic UV absorbance, due to its phenolic group. When working with tyrosine, especially in its isolated form, it's essential to maintain it in environments free from oxidizing agents, as it can be readily oxidized.
