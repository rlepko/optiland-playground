<h1>Microscopy mounting media</h1>

Microscopy mounting media are specialized substances used to preserve and stabilize biological specimens on microscope slides for examination. These media often come in the form of liquid solutions, gels, or resins, and serve to immobilize the sample, protect it from environmental degradation, and sometimes even enhance the contrast or fluorescence of the specimen. The choice of mounting media can be critical, as it must be compatible with both the sample and the specific microscopy technique being used. Some common types of mounting media include aqueous-based media for water-soluble samples, and resin-based media for long-term preservation. Specialized mounting media may also contain anti-fading agents to prolong the lifespan of fluorescent signals. Overall, the proper selection and application of mounting media is essential for optimal microscopy results.
